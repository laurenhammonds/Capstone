# Wild Card Case Study

For my case study, I created a website for users to purchase handmade items! The user can create an account, log in to their account, view and search products, and view past orders. 

- Backend was made using Java Spring Boot 
- Frontend uses HTML, CSS,  and JSP
- Other tools used: Eclipse, MySQL Workbench, VSCode, Spring Boot

In the future, I'd like to get my cart up and starting to process orders. I also plan on improving the frontend to improve the user's experience.
